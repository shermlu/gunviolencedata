This notebook uses a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data) that contains gun violence data in America from 2013-2018. Github does not render Plotly charts, so the entire notebook can be seen here: https://github.com/shermlu/gunviolencedata/blob/master/Gun%20Violence%20Analysis.ipynb?flush_cache=true
